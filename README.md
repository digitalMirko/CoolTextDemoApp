# CoolTextDemoApp

Swift - Cool Text Demo App

App created in Xcode 10.1 (10B61) using Swift 4.2 and tested on a iPhone X Emulator

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Cool Text Demo App' icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a large label on the top part of the screen with a TextField right below where the user can enter some
of their own text via a pop up keyboard. Then right below are the various buttons which give the user different effects to
apply to the text on top. Effects like changing the color from Red to Green to Blue. Then there are four different fonts which 
can be enabled to change the text to those fonts. The buttons show the kind of font that will be enabled when pressed. Right 
below that is an option to either Add a Shadow or Remove a shadow from the text. Then finally on the bottom a series of 
buttons which change the font size from small to medium or large. Its a fun interesting way to see how text will react.
